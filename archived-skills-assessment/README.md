## What This Assessment Did

Complete 2-round skills assessment with 45 skills:
- **Round 1:** Love it/Like it/Dislike it (enjoyment rating)
- **Round 2:** Expert/Skilled/Beginner (skill level for liked skills only)
- **Output:** Top 5 skills based on combined enjoyment + skill scores

## Technical Details
